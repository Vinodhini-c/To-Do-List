## To-Do List Project

This mini-project is a simple and interactive To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed, providing a practical tool for managing daily activities. The focus of this project was to enhance my skills in front-end development and understand the core concepts of DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage in JavaScript.

A simple To-Do List app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The app uses local storage to persist tasks, ensuring they remain even after a page refresh. This project helped me improve my front-end development skills, focusing on DOM manipulation, event handling, and creating interactive interfaces.

## Features:

Add Tasks: Users can input tasks they need to complete

Mark Tasks as Complete: Users can mark tasks as completed, which visually updates the task's appearance.

Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list once completed or if no longer needed.

This project helped me solidify my understanding of JavaScript, especially in managing dynamic content and creating user-friendly interfaces.
